The Seven Cures/Golden Rules:
- Start thy purse to fattening: Save at least one-tenth (10%) of everything you earn.

- Control thy expenditures: Distinguish between necessary expenses and desires, and don't let wants outgrow your income.

- Make thy gold multiply: Learn to invest your savings so your money works for you and generates more wealth (e.g., "make its children work").

- Guard thy treasures from loss: Protect your wealth by seeking wise advice and avoiding risky schemes or bad investments.

- Make of thy dwelling a profitable investment: Own your home or find ways to make your living situation an asset, not just a cost.

- Insure a future income: Plan for old age and security by building investments that provide a steady income stream.

- Increase thy ability to earn: Continuously improve your skills and knowledge to become more valuable and earn more money.
