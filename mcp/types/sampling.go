//Because LLMs can vary along multiple dimensions, choosing the "best" model is
//rarely straightforward.  Different models excel in different areasâ€”some are

//on. This interface allows servers to express their priorities across multiple
//dimensions to help clients make an appropriate selection for their use case.

//balance them against other considerations.
